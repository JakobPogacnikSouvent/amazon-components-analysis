# Analysis of computer components on Amazon

In this project I will analyze the top 10.000 products in the section of Computers > Computer Components > Internal Components on [amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/s?i=computers-intl-ship&bbn=16225007011&rh=n%3A16225007011%2Cn%3A193870011%2Cn%3A17923671011%2Cp_n_availability%3A2661601011&s=review-rank&dc&qid=1634574488&rnid=2661599011&ref=sr_nr_p_n_availability_2) sorted by average customer review.

Each entry in the database will consist of:
* Name
* Rating
* Number of reviews
* Avalability (whether the product is in stock)
* Whether the product ships to Slovenia
* Type of product (e.g. GPU, CPU, Fan...)

# Hypotheses and goals

Some of the hypotheses and goals I will try to find out with my data analysis are:
* Correlation between popularity and price
* What type of product is the most popular
* Correlation between available shipping to Slovenia and popularity
* Correlation between available shipping to Slovenia and price
