# Analysis advertisements on Bolha

In this project I will analyze the top 10.000 products in the section of Computers on the slovenian flea market website [Bolha](https://www.bolha.com/racunalnistvo) sorted by descending price.

Each entry in the database will consist of:
* Name of advert
* Location (city)
* Location (district)
* Date of publication
* Price
* Type of product (derived from name)

# Hypotheses and goals

Some of the hypotheses and goals I will try to find out with my data analysis are:
* Create an algorythm to classify product (derive type from name)
* Which types of product are most expensive
* Corellation between city and product type
* Correlation between city and product price
* Which types of product have the oldest adverts
